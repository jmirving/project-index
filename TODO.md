1. [x] Define values for the status of each repo and make it more visually prominent. I like WIP but there is a difference between "this is a work in progress" and "I forgot this even existed". The ScanReconciliationTool was code I wrote for a company I used to work at and have saved personally as a "demo" of code I wrote (back in 2020 or so). This will never be updated again so, it should have an appropriate status and no future ideas. There likely needs to be some kind of "one-off" or "test/demo" option to indicate that the repo itself isn't a project?
2. [x] Can we find and add a last updated date (would likely need a "last updated" for the project-index data then as well)?
3. [x] Can we include whether or not base files are present? I would think readme, agents.md, make, gitignore, license, any others?
4. [x] What about some kind of "how to start" or like... "one click to get back invested" or something?
5. [x] Add a default intelligent ordering for projects (static for now; dynamic later).
6. [x] Add a deployment type field? cpm-detail deploys via Render. This project is via github pages, etc. Ideally, this would eventually link to those places
